# Themes of The Mahabharata
The Mahabharata is a complex and multifaceted epic that deals with a wide range of themes and issues that are still relevant today. The main themes that appear throughout this epic are:

- Dharma (Duty): Dharma is the central theme of the Mahabharata, the idea of fulfilling one's duties, acting according to one's role in one's life, and upholding moral principles. The 
  characters in this epic face many dilemmas and challenges that force them to make difficult decisions based on their understanding of dharma.
- Karma (Action): Another major topic in the Mahabharata is that every action has repercussions, both in this life and in those to come. The idea of karma is utilised to explain both 
  the good and negative things that happen to the characters in the epic as they struggle with the results of their deeds.#
- Free Will vs. Fate: Mahabharata tackles conflict between free will and fate, with characters occasionally finding it difficult to bring the two together. The epic argues that although 
  individuals may have some influence over their choices, there are more powerful forces at play that eventually determine their fate.
- Nature of Human Existence: The Mahabharata dives deeply into the nature of human existence, posing queries about what it is to live, why we suffer, and how important love and 
  connections are to our existence.

The characters in the epic grapple with a variety of moral and ethical decisions that have far-reaching effects. For instance, Yudhishthira must decide between keeping his honour and 
carrying out his responsibilities as a monarch and ensuring the safety of his family when he is offered to gamble away his kingdom and his brothers. In the Kurukshetra conflict, 
Arjuna also wrestles with the moral choice of fighting against members of his own family.

Numerous lessons from the Mahabharata are still applicable today. The notion that one's actions have consequences and that we must be conscious of the influence of our decisions is 
one of the most crucial. The value of upholding one's convictions in the face of challenging situations is another lesson. 

In addition, the epic emphasises the value of relationships? with family and with others?
as well as the significance of love and compassion in our lives.
