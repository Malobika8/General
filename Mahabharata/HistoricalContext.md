# Historical Context

Final version of the Mahabharata was created between the eighth century BCE and the fourth century CE. Ancient India was undergoing major changes during this time in its social, 
political, and religious domains.

A notable transformation occurred as tribal societies gave way to established kingdoms, and this shift is vividly captured in the Mahabharata. The epic portrays a diverse array of 
kingdoms and their rulers, showcasing the intricate web of conflicts and alliances that arose during this period. Additionally, the Mahabharata offers insights into the evolving 
social order, with the emergence of fresh classes, including the merchant class epitomized by the Pandavas.

Emergence of Hinduism as India's preeminent religion was another notable development during this time. Through its depictions of many gods and goddesses, including Lord Krishna, who 
is regarded in Hinduism as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the Mahabharata represents this. Hinduism's core philosophical and ethical principles, such as the notions of dharma 
(righteousness), karma (the law of cause and effect), and moksha (liberation), are all present in the Mahabharata.

Overall, the Mahabharata reflects the cultural, social, and religious changes that were happening in ancient India during its composition. It offers a glimpse into the historical 
context in which it was written, as well as the beliefs, values, and aspirations of the people who composed and transmitted this epic over the centuries.
